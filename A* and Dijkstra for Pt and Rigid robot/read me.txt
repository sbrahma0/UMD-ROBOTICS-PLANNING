The programs are made in python using pycharm

Packages used are 
operator
and pygame

A* and Dijkstra for point robot

First you need to enter the grid size/resolution- since it does not consist of any marks so i request you to keep it to 1
Then the starting coordinates separated by commas
Then enter the goal coordinates separated by commas

The output window will show the starting point but not the goal point
After the goal is reached(is possible) the path will be highlited in red colour
*** There is a problem with the pycharm window, if the goal point is very near to the source, you may have to click the window manually,
incase if it does not pop up automatically, though there is a delay of 10000 ms so it will be enough to see the path.


A* and Dijkstra for rigid bot

First you need to enter the grid size/resolution- since it does not consist of any marks so i request you to keep it to 1
Then enter the robot diameter(in mm)
Then enter the clearence(in mm)
Then the starting coordinates separated by commas
Then enter the goal coordinates separated by commas

The generated mab and the boundary is made using Minkowsky sum and half planes and the whole obstacles are shown in black.
The output window does not show the starting and the goal point.
Since this program is intended for rigid robot so i request you to give atleast either of robot diameter or clearance.
After the goal is reached(is possible) the path will be highlited in red colour
*** There is a problem with the pycharm window, if the goal point is very near to the source, you may have to click the window manually,
incase if it does not pop up automatically, though there is a delay of 10000 ms so it will be enough to see the path.
